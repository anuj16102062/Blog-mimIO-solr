Data Foundation Blog and MinIO Metadata Search

This project involves setting up a blog engine using Ghost, creating a JSON structure for blogs, and building Node.js web services for blog-related and metadata-based search using MinIO and Solr.
Task 1: Setup Ghost Blog Engine and Create Sample Blogs
Step 1: Setup Ghost Blog Engine

Follow these steps to set up the Ghost blog engine:

    Install Node.js and npm on your system if not already installed.

    Install Ghost CLI by running the following command:

    bash

npm install -g ghost-cli

Create a new directory for your Ghost blog and navigate to it.

Install Ghost using the Ghost CLI:

bash

    ghost install

    Follow the setup prompts to configure your blog.

Step 2: Create Sample Blogs

Manually create a set of sample blogs related to data foundation using the content from Data Foundation.
Task 2: Define JSON Structure for Blogs and Build Node.js Web Services

Define a JSON structure to represent a blog. Each blog should have a unique ID. Then, create Node.js web services for blog-related operations.
Step 1: Define JSON Structure

Define the JSON structure to represent a blog, including fields such as id, title, content, author, publishedDate, and more.
Step 2: Create Node.js Web Services

Create Node.js web services to perform the following operations:

a) List of all published blogs.
b) List of all published blogs published in the last one week.
c) Get the content of a blog with a given ID or Blog Title.
Task 3: Create Metadata-Based Search API using MinIO and Solr

This task involves setting up MinIO, ingesting diverse types of movie-related objects with custom metadata, and creating Node.js web services for metadata-based search using Solr.
Step 1: Setup MinIO

Follow these steps to set up MinIO:

    Download and install MinIO from the official website.

    Configure MinIO with access and secret keys, and create buckets for different types of assets.

    Ingest poster images, trailer videos, and songs audio with custom metadata. Each asset type may have different metadata fields.

Step 2: Create Node.js Web Services

Create a set of Node.js web services to search for trailers, videos, and songs based on custom metadata. These services should connect to MinIO to perform the search.

Task 4: Implement Solr and Node.js Keyword Search
  Istall solr from official website 
  Download large dataset from online 
Import on solr core
Created Node js application for search which is much faster as compare to normal one

This README provides an outline of the tasks and steps required to set up the blog engine, create sample blogs, define JSON structures, and build web services for blog operations and metadata-based search. It also highlights the need to implement Solr-based keyword search for datasets from Data Foundation. You can add more details, specific commands, and instructions as needed for your project.
